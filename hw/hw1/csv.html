                    Python has an very powerful and easy-to-use CSV reader and writer functionality
                    built into it. It can be used to read CSV's and extract data to be placed into lists
                    or dictionaries. It can reiterate through multiple CSV files in one folder. It can write
                    the contents of a string, array, list, or dictionary to a CSV file. This capability
                    is very useful when it comes through analyzing large CSV files generated by other programs.
                    CSV files are widely used among other programs and devices as their data outputs so with 
                    Python having the capability to manipulate these types of files, makes it a very, very 
                    useful language. A great (and free!) tutorial of CSV parsing and the entire language, including
                    libraries that allow you extract data from images, PDF's, and Excel files, is an online book
                    called, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart The link can be found in the sources.
